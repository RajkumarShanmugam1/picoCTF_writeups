# Nice netcat

## Overview

Points: 15
Category: General

## Description

> There is a nice program that you can talk to by using this command in a shell: $ nc mercury.picoctf.net 43239, but it doesn't speak English...

## Hints

1. You can practice using netcat with this picoGym problem: [what's a netcat?](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/34)
2. You can practice reading and writing ASCII with this picoGym problem: [Let's Warm Up](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/22)

## Approach

First I connected to `mercury.picoctf.net 43239` on a Linux terminal.

It gave these numbers:
> 112
105
99
111
67
84
70
123
103
48
48
100
95
107
49
116
116
121
33
95
110
49
99
51
95
107
49
116
116
121
33
95
55
99
48
56
50
49
102
53
125
10

These numbers are most likely ASCII values for text. I got tired of trying to look for an online source to decode it. I tried about 3 and they all didn't work. I wrote up a Python script

```python
nums = [112, 105, 99, 111, 67, 84, 70, 123, 103, 48, 48, 100, 95, 107, 49, 116, 116, 121, 33, 95, 110, 49, 99, 51, 95, 107, 49, 116, 116, 121, 33, 95, 55, 99, 48, 56, 50, 49, 102, 53, 125, 10]
flag = ""
for number in nums:
    flag += chr(number)
print(flag)
```
